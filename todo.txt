WDL-OL/IPlug2 TODOs:

ALL - document all main interface headers with decent doxygen comments, remove random comments from source code this
ALL - bring disparate documentation together into doxygen pages

IPlug:

ALL - IParam improvements e.g. using lambdas for custom readout ranges
ALL - cmake support
ALL - templated processor class for single/double precision and WAM support
ALL - make side chain/multi-channel definitions more consistent and more flexible, i.e. mono or stereo SC
ALL - GetHostVersionStr() etc are not reliable, especially with AU
AU - preset changing from inside the plugin doesn't consistently update logic's GUI
AU - auval "preset name not retained" message
AU - SendMidiMsg() not implemented
AU - possibility of instruments with multichannel output, e.g. 5.1
AU - possibility of instruments with side-chain inputs
VST3 - SendMidiMsg()
VST3 - pitch bend & other common MIDI CC parameters
AAX - "continuous" gui controls linked to enumerated list parameters jump around
AAX - multi-mono with PLUG_DOES_STATE_CHUNKS 1 doesn't sync instances
AAX - auxiliary output stems for instruments with multiple outs
AAX - SendMidiMsg/s
APP - edit to use IPlugBase buffer attaching code
APP - some keys not received by windows standalone...arrow keys for example DLGC_WANTARROWS
APP - how to change audio devices without hanging the main loop?
APP - fade out audio stream when changing settings?
APP - make it work with no audio input & look at PLUG_IS_INST
APP - make it work with variable i/o count
APP - make it work with non-gui plugins
APP - transport & tempo generator
APP - missing functions in IPlugStandalone.h
APP - windows midi - sendmidimsg() crash
APP - windows midi - MS Built in GS Synth crashes when selected in prefs (XP)
APP - state persistence - save fxp & option
APP - look again at JACK client osx
APP - get latency and display
APP - remove per plug-in wrapper, replace with global code

IGraphics:

ALL - IKeyboardControl should be made vectorial by default and included in IControls
ALL - add a few common IControls
ALL - resizing/arbitrary rescaling of the entire ui
ALL - reliable window sizing
ALL - better drag-and-drop
ALL - animation
ALL - hashing of static data wrong
ALL - fps/performance benchmarking
ALL - more flexible resource importing (not just png resources)
ALL - improve text entry dimensions / text size
IGraphicsLice - text dimensions on retina/non-retina different for non-monospaced fonts
IGraphicsLice - replace LICE text with freetype/stbtruetype?
IGraphicsCairo - text
IGraphicsAGG - text
IGraphicsAGG - svg
IGraphicsAGG - scaling
IGraphicsAGG - strict/non strict mode not working
IGraphicsNanoVG - text
IGraphicsNanoVG - svg
